# Labs and Practical work

 > Practical work is a critical part of this course.
    We emphasis greatly on the paractical work in order to understand the working of all component in any digital system.

 # Lab resources: A way forward
 
 > We will use software resources listed below (will be updated as the course progresses). These resources will help you develop
 understanding of any digital system in real-world applications. 
 
  >> + Tinkercad (circuit simulation)
  >> + Arduino IDE or VSCode + Platformio (extension inside vscode)
  >> + ESP32 development board
  >> + ...

# Hardware: OH No...
+ Start going through the lessons. (You may not understand the code at first. but don't panic we are planning to explain that in labs.)
+ # We know, Its challenging to work with hardware but aren't you curious about it?

# It's amazing!
